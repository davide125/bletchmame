# BletchMAME

BletchMAME is a new experimental front end for MAME.  Unlike existing front ends (which function as launchers, keeping MAME's internal UI), BletchMAME replaces the internal MAME UI with a more conventional point and click GUI to provide a friendlier experience in a number of areas (such as profiles, input configuration and a number of others).  While BletchMAME is intended to support all machines supported by MAME, it should be particularly suitable to computer emulation.

## Running BletchMAME

To run BletchMAME, run the installer (BletchMAME.msi on Windows) and BletchMAME will install.  The first thing you must do is point BletchMAME at a locally installed version of MAME 0.213 or later.  BletchMAME will take some time to read info from MAME, and when this is complete you can run the emulation.

## Version History

TBD; BletchMAME is not 1.0 yet!
